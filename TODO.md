# TODO

* The addition of `s` to string literals needs to be more robust, and check if within quotes or not.
* The entire standard library is missing, with the exception of:
  * `fmt.Println`
  * `fmt.Print`
* Add a `main_test.go` that builds and calls the executables, then compare the output with the output from the executables built with the go compiler.
