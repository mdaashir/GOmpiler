# C++ Compiler in Go

A complete C++ compiler implemented in Go. This project demonstrates how to build a compiler from scratch, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Features

- Lexical Analysis: Converts C++ source code into tokens
- Parsing: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
- Semantic Analysis: Validates the AST for semantic correctness
- Code Generation: Generates LLVM IR code from the AST
- Basic Optimization

## Requirements

- Go 1.24 or later
- LLVM toolchain (for final compilation steps)

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the compiler:
